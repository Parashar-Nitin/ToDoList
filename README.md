# To-Do List (React)

## Overview  
A simple **To-Do List** web application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are persisted in the **Local Storage**, allowing them to remain across browser sessions. The app features task filtering, showing only completed tasks when needed.

- **Edit Tasks:** Modify any existing task.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Check/uncheck tasks as completed.
- **Filter Tasks:** Toggle to show only completed tasks.
- **Persistence:** All tasks are saved in **Local Storage** for persistent data.

## Technologies Used
